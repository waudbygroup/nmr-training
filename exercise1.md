# Exercise 1

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

{: .warning }
This is a warning.

{: .note }
> This is a note.
> with a second line

And back to paragraphs.
